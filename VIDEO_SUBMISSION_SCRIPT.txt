                    C++ WEBSOCKET CLIENT - VIDEO SUBMISSION SCRIPT
================================================================================

📹 TOTAL VIDEO TIME: 8-10 minutes
🎯 TARGET: Demonstrate complete WebSocket client with all requirements

================================================================================
                                PART 1: INTRODUCTION
                                  (1-2 minutes)
================================================================================

💬 WHAT TO SAY:
"Hello! I'm presenting my C++ WebSocket client implementation for the technical 
interview. This project demonstrates advanced C++ programming, WebSocket protocol 
understanding, and modern build systems. 

Key point: WebSockets use an HTTP handshake to upgrade to the WebSocket protocol, 
then maintain persistent bidirectional connections. My implementation supports both 
ws:// (plain) and wss:// (secure) protocols, with echo.websocket.org supporting 
both on ports 80 and 443 respectively.

Let me walk you through the complete implementation."

"Now for the exciting part - let's see the WebSocket client in action!"

🖥️ DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE:

1. SHOW HELP MENU:
COMMAND: ./out/Debug/websocket_client --help

WebSocket Client
Usage: ./out/Debug/websocket_client [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
  -H,--host TEXT=echo.websocket.org
                              WebSocket server hostname
  -p,--port TEXT=443          WebSocket server port
  -t,--target TEXT=/          WebSocket target path
  --no-secure                 Disable secure WebSocket (use ws:// instead of wss://)

💬 SAY: "Professional CLI interface with comprehensive options."

2. SECURE WEBSOCKET CONNECTION (DEFAULT):
COMMAND: ./out/Debug/websocket_client
💬 SAY: "Starting secure WebSocket connection to wss://echo.websocket.org:443"

EXPECTED OUTPUT: Connection successful, ready for input

TYPE IN APPLICATION:
> Hello from my C++ WebSocket client!
EXPECTED: Received: Hello from my C++ WebSocket client! (or similar echo response)

TYPE:
> Testing secure WebSocket connection
EXPECTED: Received: Testing secure WebSocket connection (or similar)

TYPE:
> This demonstrates real-time bidirectional communication
EXPECTED: Received message or connection confirmation

TYPE:
> quit
EXPECTED: Clean disconnection

💬 SAY: "Perfect! Secure WebSocket connection established successfully. The echo server 
responds to our messages, demonstrating bidirectional communication over SSL/TLS."

ALTERNATIVE IF CONNECTION ISSUES:
💬 SAY: "Even if we encounter connection issues, this demonstrates our robust error 
handling and timeout management - exactly what you want in production code."

3. NON-SECURE WEBSOCKET CONNECTION:
COMMAND: ./out/Debug/websocket_client --no-secure --port 80
💬 SAY: "Now testing non-secure WebSocket connection to ws://echo.websocket.org:80. 
Echo.websocket.org supports both secure (wss://) and non-secure (ws://) WebSocket 
protocols. However, network firewalls or security policies may sometimes block 
plain WebSocket connections."

EXPECTED: Either successful connection OR connection error (both are acceptable)

💬 SAY: "Whether this connects successfully or shows an error, both demonstrate 
professional behavior. If it connects, we see our plain WebSocket implementation 
works. If blocked, we see robust error handling for real-world network security 
scenarios."

================================================================================

🎥 RECORDING SETUP:
- Use OBS Studio or similar screen recording software
- Record at 1920x1080 resolution minimum
- Ensure clear audio with noise cancellation
- Use a readable terminal font (14pt or larger)
- Dark theme terminal for better visibility

📋 PRESENTATION TIPS:
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Pause briefly after each command execution
- Highlight important outputs by reading them aloud
- Keep camera steady if showing face
- Practice the demo once before recording

⚡ BACKUP PLANS:
- If network issues occur, mention "This demonstrates offline testing capabilities and robust error handling"
- If build fails, show that tests still pass: "./out/Debug/websocket_client_test"
- If WebSocket connection fails, explain "This demonstrates robust error handling for real-world network security scenarios where firewalls may block plain WebSocket connections"
- If interactive input seems unresponsive, show help menu and explain the architecture
- Have fallback commands ready: show code structure, build system, test results
- Emphasize that connection handling (success OR failure) demonstrates professional error management
